			We act in disputed claims, in relation to both defence and coverage issues, involving domestic and international litigation and arbitration.  We also advise on policy construction and the application of terms and conditions of a policy to the facts of individual or multiple losses. We conduct drafting work, advise on regulatory issues and carry out transactional work – see <a href="/commercial-transactional-regulatory/">Commercial, Transactional and Regulatory</a>.
		</p>

		<p>We work with both UK and international insurers, Lloyd’s and those involved in <a href="/broking-agency/">Broking and Agency</a>. Our lawyers are experienced in handling multi-jurisdictional issues arising from international risks and coordinating the requisite representation with overseas lawyers.
