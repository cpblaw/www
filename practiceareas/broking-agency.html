<p>We have specialist knowledge of the broking and insurance intermediary markets and advise on issues of both a contentious and non-contentious nature. We have a thorough understanding not only of the legal and regulatory framework and of the commercial pressures applicable to acting as an intermediary in the market, but also of the issues that arise in practice.</p>

<p>In addition, we act for a number of international brokers who place business into the London Market. We also assist with the passporting of EU intermediaries to provide insurance to UK consumers.</p>

	{% accordion 'What we do' %}
		<p>As well as being instructed on <a href="/commercial-transactional-regulatory/">Commercial, Transactional and Regulatory</a> issues, we have extensive experience of advising on, and handling claims relating to, insurance intermediaries, their principals, their clients, their liquidators and their professional indemnity insurers.</p>

		<p>In addition, we have acted on behalf of:-</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Insurance and reinsurance brokers in the London market.</li>
			<li>Overseas producing brokers.</li>
			<li>Managing general agents (“MGAs”), underwriting agents, coverholders and intermediaries holding authority to bind their principals.</li>
			<li>Appointed representatives.</li>
			<li>Inspection agents.</li>
			<li>Third party administrators (“TPAs”) and run-off managers. </li>
		</ul>

		<p>We deal with the full range of professional negligence claims alleged against brokers and other agents, from the smallest claims brought by litigants in person, through to claims of the highest value and complexity involving a number of parties in both a domestic and international context.  We act for professional indemnity insurers and for brokers or agents themselves in relation defence, coverage and contractual disputes, and in commercial, corporate and regulatory matters.</p>

		<p>We act for UK and overseas insurance brokers and their clients in pursuing the “difficult” claims in the international insurance and reinsurance market, often involving fronting arrangements.  In doing so, we act as a form of “claims counsel” to support the claims process. This results in a saving of time and can increase the amount recovered.  Whether retained by the broker or the insured or reinsured themselves, the presentation of a claim on the basis of an accurate legal analysis of coverage can enhance the reputation of our client generally within the market.</p>

		<p>Many underwriters, producing brokers and insureds have had the experience of an inadequate service in the handling of accounts.  We are experienced in working with brokers to resolve such difficulties, promptly, efficiently and cost-effectively.</p>

		<p>We are also experienced in dealing with the “failing” broker, protecting premium and claims funds and, if necessary, petitioning for the appointment of a liquidator.</p>
