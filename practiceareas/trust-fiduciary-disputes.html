	Wealth management, global investment and fund management and taxation optimisation are some of the increasingly complex structures that depend on both trust and trusts. They also demand great depths of knowledge and decisive action.
</p>

	Our lawyers have been working successfully in this field for 40 years. Bill Perry has regularly been a ‘Prominent Figure’ in Citywealth’s ranking and was named as one of the ‘Top 100 Lawyers in London’ for his work in this area.

	{% accordion 'What we do' %}
		<p>We advise on ways to reconcile differences of opinion and make Trusts relationships and structures work better. This may involve redrafting deeds, changing personnel (including advisers), reconsidering strategies or getting people to focus on what really matters.</p>
		<p>If there are issues which cannot be resolved amicably, we draw on our  knowledge to adopt the appropriate tactics to obtain the best result for our clients.</p>
		<p>We advise about charitable and private national and international trusts. We have experience of dealing with many foreign jurisdictions, multi-party disputes involving multiple proceedings, civil law structures, the duties of those running them and how they should operate.</p>
		<p>Our clients include beneficiaries, legatees, settlors, trustees and executors. We have obtained undertakings and injunctions. We have restored to cut-out legatees and beneficiaries what was rightfully theirs and removed from those who had appropriated them what they had wrongfully taken.</p>
