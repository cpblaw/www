<p>Reinsurance is a field requiring specialist expertise in the customs and practices of the international marketplace.  Our lawyers have been at the heart of that marketplace for the last 30 years. We are active in a broad range of reinsurance business, including alternative risk transfer, facultative, ILS backed, proportional, non-proportional and treaty.</p>

We are experienced in handling complex international reinsurance litigation and arbitration.  We advise on issues arising from reinsurance contracts, such as “follow the settlements”, aggregation issues, “back-to-back”, duty of good faith, applicable law, international jurisdiction, underwriting authority and intra-pool relationships.  We are active in both non-life and life markets and in both the live and run-off markets.</p>

		<p>We have been involved in some of the major issues facing the reinsurance market, ranging from conducting the successful appeal to the House of Lords in the leading international reinsurance case <em>AGF & WASA v Lexington</em>, to the litigation involving aviation reinsurance claims arising from the Ukraine war.</p>
