	<p>(Re)insurance is one of the most globally inter-connected and interdependent businesses in the world.  It is vital for a law firm specialising in this field to have a supportive international network: one which has specialised expertise, covers the main world-wide (re)insurance centres, and whose members work together harmoniously, based on their knowledge of their countries’ law, (re)insurance systems, and each other.</p>

	<p>Our firm is the UK member of Insuralex - the only Chambers Global-ranked Band 1 global network of specialist insurance and reinsurance law firms.  Its members span five continents offering unrivalled global expertise in this field. In addition, our lawyers are members of world-wide networks of defence, (re)insurance and corporate lawyers, covering over 50 countries – the International Association of Defense Counsel (“IADC”), and the Federation of Defense and Corporate Counsel (“FDCC”). </p>

	<p>Through these networks we are able to call upon assistance from leading lawyers in top ranking law firms in the USA and all over the world.</p>

		{% accordion 'Insuralex' %}
			<p>Insuralex has over 50 member firms from countries all over the globe.</p>

			<p>Insuralex members are independent firms with specialisms in insurance, reinsurance and risk management.  We meet and work together regularly: our people know each other personally and there is trust and confidence between the firms, as well as great experience and expertise in handling cross-border legal work.  Each member is considered to be a leading practice in insurance and reinsurance within its national jurisdiction.  Together we can navigate you through the complexities of differing local laws and procedures, which affect the conduct of insurance business on a cross-border basis.</p>

			<p>Although we have one of the highest rates of referrals among Insuralex members (both outwards and inwards), we have no obligation to refer within Insuralex.  This is important as it leaves us free to work with your preferred choice of overseas lawyers.</p>

			<p>Insuralex members work for a wide range of clients worldwide, across the insurance, reinsurance and risk management industries including insurance and reinsurance companies, Lloyd’s syndicates, brokers and agents as well as captives and corporations.</p>

				<div class="media-body align-self-end">
					<p>Each Insuralex member is elected following a detailed selection process to ensure all members are of the high standard required by the network. Insuralex and its members believe in pro-activity, deep and long term relationships with clients, commercial awareness, high quality standards and pragmatism.</p>
