<p>Carter Perry Bailey LLP was formed in 2009.  Our founding members, <a href="/people/stephen-carter/">Stephen Carter</a>, <a href="/people/bill-perry/">Bill Perry</a> and <a href="/people/bernadette-bailey/">Bernadette Bailey</a> had a vision to create a specialist practice in the City of London, based on traditional values but using modern techniques.  With encouragement and support from their clients, in the UK and overseas, they created Carter Perry Bailey, practicing from our Lloyd’s Avenue office.</p>

<p>The founding partners specialise in insurance and reinsurance (both contentious and non-contentious), commercial litigation, arbitration and trust & fiduciary disputes.  These remain the firm’s primary focus.</p>

<p>Soon after our formation, CPB successfully represented AGF Insurance in the seminal international reinsurance case <em>AGF & WASA v Lexington</em>, one of the last House of Lords judgments to be handed down before it became the Supreme Court.</p>

<p>Respected senior practitioners have also joined the firm, enhancing the classes of business in which we practice.  <a href="/people/anthony-rose/">Anthony Rose</a> carries out transactional and corporate work; <a href="/people/paul-bugden/">Paul Bugden</a>, marine, aviation, transport and energy; <a href="/people/joseph-sutton/">Joseph Sutton</a>, employment; <a href="/people/robert-harrison/">Robert Harrison</a>, property, professional risks and regulatory, in particular offshore captives and cell bodies.</p>

<p>In 2010, we were honoured to be invited to join the prestigious <a href="/international-networks/">Insuralex</a> network as its exclusive UK member.  In 2011, Bill Perry was elected President of the <a href="/international-networks/">International Association of Defense Counsel</a> (the first non-American to hold the post), just one of the international and London Market bodies in which our partners are now active.  The following year, he was elected Insuralex President, a two year term of office.</p>

<p>Since the firm’s formation, our expertise has been recognised by Legal 500, Chambers Guide, Who’s Who Legal, Leaders League and Citywealth Legal.  Both the firm and its lawyers individually have received a number of <a href="/awards/">Awards</a> each year since formation, recognising our work in insurance, reinsurance, arbitration, professional liability and trust/fiduciary disputes.</p>
