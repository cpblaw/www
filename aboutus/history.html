<p>Carter Perry Bailey LLP was formed in 2009. Our founding members were <a href="/people/stephen-carter/">Stephen Carter</a>, <a href="/people/bill-perry/">Bill Perry</a> and <a href="/people/bernadette-bailey/">Bernadette Bailey</a>. Together, they had a vision to create a niche specialist practice in the City of London, based on traditional values but utilising modern techniques. With encouragement and support from their clients, they created Carter Perry Bailey LLP in May 2009, practicing from our Lloyd’s Avenue office.</p>

<p>The founding partners specialise in insurance and reinsurance (both contentious and non-contentious), commercial litigation, arbitration and trust & fiduciary disputes. These remain the firm’s primary focus.</p>

<p>Soon after our formation, CPB successfully represented AGF Insurance in the seminal reinsurance case AGF & WASA v Lexington, one of the last House of Lords judgments to be handed down before it became the Supreme Court.</p>

<p><a href="/people/william-sturge/">William Sturge</a>, a Partner in the insurance & reinsurance group of another large City firm, shared our vision, and moved to join us in 2010. Since then, respected senior insurance and reinsurance lawyers have also joined the firm as consultants. <a href="/people/anthony-rose/">Anthony Rose</a> and <a href="/people/hugh-bohling/">Hugh Bohling</a> (the latter with his niche corporate insurance practice), bolstered our corporate and commercial capabilities. Robert Harrison added further insurance/reinsurance experience and most recently Joseph Sutton brought us employment law expertise.</p>

<p>In 2015, <a href="/people/mark-aizlewood/">Mark Aizlewood</a> and <a href="/people/simon-thomas/">Simon Thomas</a> also joined our partnership bringing a professional and financial risks practice, which Mark now heads.  In 2019, the firm expanded its expertise in Life, Accident and Health (LAH) insurance, when LAH expert, <a href="/people/helen-tilley/">Helen Tilley</a>, joined the partnership from Kennedys, making Carter Perry Bailey one of the very few law firms that includes a specialist LAH practice.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, in 2010, we were honoured to be invited to join the prestigious <a href="/international-networks/">Insuralex</a> network as its exclusive UK member. In 2012, Bill Perry, was elected Insuralex President, a two year term of office. In the same year, Bill Perry was elected President of the <a href="/international-networks/">International Association of Defense Counsel</a> (the first non-American to hold the post), just one of the international and London Market bodies in which our partners are now active.</p>

<p>Since the firm’s formation, our expertise has been recognised by Legal 500, Chambers Guide, Who’s Who Legal and Citywealth Legal. Both the firm and its lawyers individually have received a number of <a href="/awards/">Awards</a> each year since formation, recognising our work in insurance, reinsurance, arbitration, professional liability and trust/fiduciary disputes.</p>
