<p>Carter Perry Bailey LLP was formed in 2009. Our founding members were <a href="/people/stephen-carter/">Stephen Carter</a>, <a href="/people/bill-perry/">Bill Perry</a> and <a href="/people/bernadette-bailey/">Bernadette Bailey</a>. Together, they had a vision to create a niche specialist practice in the City of London, based on traditional values but utilising modern techniques. With encouragement and support from their clients, in the UK and overseas, they created Carter Perry Bailey, practicing from our Lloyd’s Avenue office.</p>

<p>The founding partners specialise in insurance and reinsurance (both contentious and non-contentious), commercial litigation, arbitration and trust & fiduciary disputes. These remain the firm’s primary focus.</p>

<p>Soon after our formation, CPB successfully represented AGF Insurance in the seminal international reinsurance case AGF & WASA v Lexington, one of the last House of Lords judgments to be handed down before it became the Supreme Court.</p>

<p>Other leading insurance and reinsurance lawyers have moved from large City firms, each bringing to CPB further specialist expertise. <a href="/people/mark-aizlewood/">Mark Aizlewood</a> and <a href="/people/simon-thomas/">Simon Thomas</a> brought their professional and financial risks practice in 2015, and in 2019, <a href="/people/helen-tilley/">Helen Tilley</a>, a leading Life, Accident & Health Insurance lawyer, joined the Partnership.</p>

<p>Respected senior insurance and reinsurance lawyers have also joined the firm as Consultants.  <a href="/people/anthony-rose/">Anthony Rose</a> (transactional/corporate and regulatory), <a href="/people/robert-harrison/">Robert Harrison</a> (insurance and reinsurance disputes), <a href="/people/paul-bugden/">Paul Bugden</a> (marine) and <a href="/people/joseph-sutton/">Joseph Sutton</a> (employment) have all enhanced our specialist offering.</p>

<p>In 2010, we were honoured to be invited to join the prestigious <a href="/international-networks/">Insuralex</a> network as its exclusive UK member. In 2011, Bill Perry, was elected Insuralex President, a two year term of office. In the same year, Bill Perry was elected President of the <a href="/international-networks/">International Association of Defense Counsel</a> (the first non-American to hold the post), just one of the international and London Market bodies in which our partners are now active. The following year, he was elected Insuralex President, a two year term of office.</p>

<p>Since the firm’s formation, our expertise has been recognised by Legal 500, Chambers Guide, Who’s Who Legal and Citywealth Legal. Both the firm and its lawyers individually have received a number of <a href="/awards/">Awards</a> each year since formation, recognising our work in insurance, reinsurance, arbitration, professional liability and trust/fiduciary disputes.</p>
