		<p>Simon began his career in 1998 in a leading national firm’s insurance team, handling solicitors’ professional indemnity claims on behalf of Solicitors Indemnity Fund Limited.   This coincided with the defence by SIF of both the Bristol &amp; West lender litigation and subsequently the Halifax managed cases.</p>

		<p>Since that time, Simon’s focus has been predominantly on the defence of claims brought against insurance brokers, barristers, IT professionals, accountants, estate agents and construction professionals.   Simon has acted for a number of Lloyd’s and London Market insurers, and their policyholders, to defend such claims in both litigation and ADR/mediation.</p>

		<p>Simon joined Carter Perry Bailey as a Partner in 2015.</p>
